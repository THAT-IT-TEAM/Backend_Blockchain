# Multi-Vendor Expense Tracker - Blockchain Infrastructure

A decentralized expense tracking system built on Hyperledger Besu with automatic node management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js & npm:** [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (npm is included)
- **Docker & Docker Compose:** [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (includes Docker Compose)
- **Git:** [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Ganache CLI:** For local blockchain development (optional, but recommended if not using a live Besu network).
  ```bash
  npm install -g ganache-cli
  ```

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the application up and running:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd Blockchain # Or whatever your cloned directory is named
    ```

2.  **Prepare the environment file:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `Backend_Blockchain/api` directory with the following content:

    ```env
    PORT=3000
    BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
    ADMIN_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY= # Optional: Provide a private key for an admin wallet, otherwise one will be generated (development only!)
    NGROK_AUTHTOKEN= # Optional: Your ngrok auth token for persistent tunnels
    NGROK_DOMAIN= # Optional: Your custom ngrok domain (requires paid ngrok plan)
    JWT_SECRET=YOUR_VERY_STRONG_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY_HERE # IMPORTANT: Replace with a strong, random string
    ```

    **Remember to replace `YOUR_VERY_STRONG_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY_HERE` with a unique, strong secret key.**

3.  **Start your blockchain network:**
    You have two options:

    - **Using Hyperledger Besu (Docker Compose):**
      Navigate to the `Blockchain` (or equivalent) directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` and `scripts` folder.
      ```bash
      cd Backend_Blockchain/docker # Assuming your docker-compose.yml is here
      docker-compose up -d
      ```
    - **Using Ganache CLI (for local development):**
      Run Ganache CLI in a separate terminal:
      ```bash
      ganache-cli --port 8545 --accounts 10 --deterministic --gasLimit 10000000
      ```
      Ensure `BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL` in your `.env` points to `http://localhost:8545`.

4.  **Install API dependencies:**
    Navigate to the API directory and install the Node.js dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd Backend_Blockchain/api
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Deploy Smart Contracts:**
    From the `Backend_Blockchain` directory, run the deployment script:

    ```bash
    cd .. # Go back to Backend_Blockchain directory if you were in api
    ./scripts/deploy-contracts.sh
    ```

    This will deploy the contracts to your running blockchain network and update `config/deployed-contracts.json`.

6.  **Start the API Server:**
    From the `Backend_Blockchain/api` directory:

    ```bash
    node blockchain-api.js
    # Or, if you have a start script configured in package.json:
    # npm start
    ```

    The API will start on the configured `PORT` (default 3000), and if ngrok is set up, it will provide a public URL.

7.  **Access the Admin Panel:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000/admin.html
    ```
    (Replace `3000` with your configured `PORT` if different).
    You can log in with an admin user created via the `/auth/register` endpoint (you'll need to use `curl` or a tool like Postman for initial user creation).

## API Endpoints

The API now features local database integration and JWT-based authentication. Remember to include the `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>` header for protected routes.

### Authentication (Public)

- `POST /auth/register` - Register a new user (admin, user, or vendor role)
- `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate a user and receive a JWT

### Health & Network (Public)

- `GET /health` - System health check
- `GET /network` - Network information

### Admin & Synchronization (Protected - Admin Role Required)

- `GET /admin/tables` - Get a list of all tables in the local SQLite database.
- `GET /api/sync-check` - Compare local user/vendor profiles with blockchain registrations.
- `POST /api/run-sync` - Run a full synchronization process (generates wallets for unsynced users, registers on blockchain).

### Users (Protected)

- `GET /api/users` - Get all users from the local database
- `GET /api/users/:address` - Get user details from the local database by blockchain wallet address
- `PUT /api/users/:address/grant-admin` - Grant admin privileges (on blockchain)
- `PUT /api/users/:address/revoke-admin` - Revoke admin privileges (on blockchain)
- `PUT /api/users/:address/deactivate` - Deactivate user (on blockchain)
- `PUT /api/users/:address/activate` - Activate user (on blockchain)

### Vendors (Protected)

- `GET /api/vendors` - Get all vendors from the local database
- `GET /api/vendors/:address` - Get vendor details from the local database by blockchain wallet address
- `GET /api/vendors/category/:category` - Get vendors by category from the local database
- `PUT /api/vendors/:address/deactivate` - Deactivate vendor (on blockchain)
- `PUT /api/vendors/:address/activate` - Activate vendor (on blockchain)

### Expenses (Protected)

- `POST /api/expenses` - Create a new expense (stores in local DB, uploads receipt to IPFS, records on blockchain). Accepts `multipart/form-data` for `receipt` file.
- `GET /api/expenses` - Get all expenses from the local database
- `GET /api/expenses/user/:address` - Get user expenses (from blockchain)
- `GET /api/expenses/vendor/:address` - Get vendor expenses (from blockchain)
- `PUT /api/expenses/:id/approve` - Approve expense (on blockchain)
- `PUT /api/expenses/:id/pay` - Pay expense (on blockchain)

## Adding New Nodes

To add a new node to the network (if using Docker Compose Besu network):

```bash
./scripts/add-node.sh node4
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Network not starting:** Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs`
- **Contracts not deploying:** Ensure the blockchain network is fully synced and accessible.
  ```bash
  ./scripts/test-network.sh
  ```
- **API not connecting:** Verify contract deployment and blockchain RPC URL in `.env`.
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/health
  ```
- **Admin Panel Login Issues:**
  - Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is set in your `Backend_Blockchain/api/.env` file.
  - Verify you're using an email and password for a user with the `admin` role. You might need to register an admin user first via `curl` to `/auth/register`.

## Development

For development, you can run individual components:

```bash
# Start only blockchain (if using Docker Compose Besu)
cd Backend_Blockchain/docker
docker-compose up bootnode validator1 validator2

# Run API in development mode (from Backend_Blockchain/api)
cd Backend_Blockchain/api
npm run dev # If you have a dev script in package.json
# Or directly: node blockchain-api.js
```

## Production Deployment

- Update `docker-compose.yml` with production settings.
- Configure proper networking and security.
- Set up monitoring and logging.
- Configure backup strategies for blockchain data.

## Security Considerations

- **Private Keys:** Automated wallet private keys are either read from `ADMIN_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env` or temporarily generated. For production, **never commit private keys to version control**. Implement secure off-chain storage for generated user wallet private keys.
- **Network Access:** Network uses permissioned accounts.
- **Admin Functions:** Admin functions require proper authorization (JWT validation and role checks).
- **API Security:** API includes rate limiting and validation (not explicitly implemented in all new endpoints but good practice).
- **JWT Secret:** Keep your `JWT_SECRET` absolutely confidential.
